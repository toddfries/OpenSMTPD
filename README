Preliminary note
================

OpenSMTPD is a FREE implementation of the server-side SMTP protocol as defined
by RFC 5321, with some additional standart extensions.

It allows ordinary machines to exchange e-mails with other systems speaking
the SMTP protocol.

OpenSMTPD runs on top of the OpenBSD operating system but also has a portable
version that can build and run on several systems, including:

	- Linux
	- FreeBSD
	- NetBSD
	- DragonFly
	- MacOSX
